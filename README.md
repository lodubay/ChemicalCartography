# Welcome to Chemical Cartography!

This mini research project is intended as an introduction to the field of
galactic archaeology for first-year undergraduates in physics and astronomy.
Specifically, it is designed to fit the requirements for the [Polaris
Mentorship Course](u.osu.edu/Polaris/mentorship-course) Spring research
project.

## Schedule

This project is intended to fit an 8-week timeline. The student should not
need to spend more than 10 hours total to complete the project.
See [SampleProjectOutline.docx](./SampleProjectOutline.docx) for a detailed
timeline.

## Setup

Make sure the student has an up-to-date Python installation with the following
packages:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- astropy

Run the [get_apogee_data.py](./get_apogee_data.py) script. This will download
the full catalog of stellar parameters (~700,000 stars) from the 17th data
release of [APOGEE](https://www.sdss4.org/surveys/apogee-2). The data download
takes several minutes and requires 3 GB of free space.
